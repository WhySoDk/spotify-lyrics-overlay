# How to use
The program executable (.exe) is in the release folder. The program should run when you click on it.

- If you already have Client ID, you can start at step 6.
- And if you use remember Client ID, you can start at step 7.
1. Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard and create a new app:  
   https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create

2. Set any App Name and App Description (these can be anything you like).

3. Under "Redirect URIs", add the following:  
   `http://127.0.0.1:5543/callback`

4. Check the boxes for:
   - Web API
   - Web Playback SDK

5. After creating the app, copy the **Client ID**.

6. Paste the **Client ID** into the program.

7. Click "Start" ‚Äî the lyrics should now appear on your screen.


# Security Concern
The Client ID will be saved as a string in a JSON file if `Remember Client Id` is checked. If you're concerned about security, please be aware of this.
